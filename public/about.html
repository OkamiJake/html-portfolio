<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a designer from Germany who is trying to learn coding - for multiple causes, like Web-Design, supporting my co-workers but also for getting into Game-Design slowly. </p>
<p>When I'm not at the computer- wait, who am I trying to fool? I'm pretty much here all the time. Might take the dog out or ride the train sometimes, but you get the idea.</p>
